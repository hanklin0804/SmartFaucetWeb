# SmartFaucetWeb
We have developed a website for a smart faucet that displays information detected from the faucet. Our website is designed using Django and NoSQL database technology. The faucet sends data to the database using the MQTT protocol. This system allows for efficient and secure transmission of data, enabling users to easily access and analyze information about their water usage.
